### Long Description (for detailed project pages)

**Autumn Knight** is a fully-featured 2D action RPG that showcases advanced game development techniques and polished gameplay mechanics. Built from the ground up using Phaser.js, this project demonstrates expertise in game architecture, physics systems, animation management, and user experience design.

#### Core Gameplay

The game centers around a unique dual-character system where players can instantly switch between two distinct heroes:

- **The Knight**: A melee-focused warrior with a 3-hit combo system, defensive blocking capabilities, and high survivability. Perfect for tanking damage and engaging enemies up close.

- **The Mage**: A ranged magic caster with powerful spell attacks, higher damage output, but lower defense. Ideal for burst damage and crowd control.

Players must master the art of character switching (E key) to maximize combat effectiveness, strategically using each character's strengths while managing their independent health pools.

#### Combat System

The combat system features:
- **Combo Mechanics**: Chain attacks within timing windows to execute devastating combos
- **Precise Hitboxes**: Custom collision detection system for accurate attack and damage calculations
- **Blocking System**: Knight can reduce incoming damage by 50% through strategic blocking
- **Magic System**: Mage can cast powerful spells with unique animations and effects

#### Enemy Waves & Progression

The game features a progressive difficulty system with three distinct waves:

1. **Wave 1 - Minotaur**: The first challenge, teaching players basic combat mechanics
2. **Wave 2 - Yamabushi Tengu**: An agile flying enemy that tests player reflexes
3. **Wave 3 - Frost Guardian Boss**: An epic final encounter with cinematic spawn animation, increased health, and challenging attack patterns

Each enemy type has unique behaviors, animations, and attack patterns, requiring players to adapt their strategy.

#### Technical Highlights

**Game Architecture:**
- Object-oriented design with modular character and enemy classes
- Event-driven system for game state management
- Efficient sprite animation management with Phaser's animation system

**Visual Systems:**
- Multi-layer parallax scrolling background with seamless looping
- Custom health bar UI system that follows characters dynamically
- Pixel-perfect sprite rendering and animation

**Audio Integration:**
- Dynamic music system that switches tracks based on game state
- Background music for normal combat
- Boss battle theme for epic encounters
- Victory fanfare upon completion

**Desktop Deployment:**
- Electron integration for native desktop application
- Cross-platform build system with Electron Builder
- Optimized asset loading for both web and desktop environments

#### Development Process

This project demonstrates:
- **Game Design**: Balancing character abilities, enemy difficulty, and player progression
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rendering, collision detection, and memory management
- **User Experience**: Intuitive controls, clear visual feedback, and responsive gameplay
- **Code Organization**: Clean, maintainable code structure with separation of concerns

#### Technologies & Tools

- **Phaser 3.90.0**: Game framework for rendering, physics, and input handling
- **JavaScript ES6+**: Modern JavaScript features including classes, modules, and async/await
- **Vite 7.1.7**: Fast build tool and development server
- **Electron 33.2.0**: Desktop application framework
- **Electron Builder**: Application packaging and distribution

#### Challenges Overcome

- Implementing seamless character switching with position and state synchronization
- Creating a responsive combo system with proper timing windows
- Building a parallax scrolling system with seamless looping
- Managing multiple animation states and preventing conflicts
- Optimizing performance for smooth 60 FPS gameplay
- Integrating Electron for desktop deployment while maintaining web compatibility
